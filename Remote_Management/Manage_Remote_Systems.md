## Click Remote Desktop
After connecting to a system, you'll see the system information on the screen, such as the power state, the unique identifier and basic settings. Take a moment to browse around and see the different bits of information available to you.

## Mesh Commander's System Defense panel

Within Mesh Commander's System Defense panel, you can add to Intel AMT network filters and policies that can be used to match certain type of network traffic. You can use Intel AMT system defense to count, drop or rate limit network traffic that matches certain rules. In this page, we look at how to create advanced filters that use the "Matching Rules" box in the "Add System Defense Filter" dialog box.

The "Matching Rules" field is a comma separated list of name and values. The names must have exact capitalization and no extra spaces must be added.

The first matching rule is the **ProtocolID**, usually TCP (6) or UDP (17). For example, if you want to match on TCP traffic, you put "ProtocolID=6" in the matching rules. You must specify a protocol id of TCP or UDP before you can use any of the other filters below.

**DestAddress** and **DestMask** to filter the destination of the packet. Both of these must be used at the same time. For example, you can set the matching rules to "ProtocolID=6,DestAddress=192.168.1.0,DestMask=255.255.255.0". This will filter all packets that go to 192.168.1.\*.

In addition, you can filter based on source address with **SrcAddress** and **SrcMask**. Both must be used at the same time. For example, you can have "ProtocolID=6,SrcAddress=192.168.1.0,SrcMask=255.255.0.0" to match all packets with a source address of 192.168.\*.
